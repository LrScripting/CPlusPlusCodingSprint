# 30 Days of C++ Learning

Welcome to my 30-day C++ learning journey repository! Here, you'll find my daily progress and code as I embark on a 30-day intensive C++ learning adventure. Each day, I'll be adding code snippets, projects, and notes as I work through different aspects of C++.
This repo contains files denoting work done on each day, this will be far less structured than my other repos and serves the purpose of documenting my progress and recording my journey.
